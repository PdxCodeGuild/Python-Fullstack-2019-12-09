# Capstone Proposal
    

## Main Concerns
    - limited API calls
    - potential dificulty making the app mobile friendly
    - lack of aesthetic skill (I don't want this thing to be an ugly baby)

## Name
    - Untitled Food Game or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Cooking

## Project Overview
    
### Major features 
    -Tinder-esque UI allowing users to swipe through recipies by image
    -Ability to flip food cards to see description/recipe
    -Recipe filter for major dietary restrictions (I'm sorry Karen, but I don't care that you don't like chickpeas and I'm not going to add a filter for them)
    -User login
    -Favorite recipse list
    -Shopping list


### Problems addressed 
    -Fight analysis paralysis in regards to picking out foods
    -Simple shopping list so I don't end up buying things I don't need
    -Make trips to the grocery store more productive

### Libraries used
    **VUEJS       DJANGO      HTML5      CSS3      Spoonacular API**

## Functionality
    

### User perspective
    -User logs in to the program  and gains access to their home page, which contains the "Start looking", "My Favorites", and "Shopping list" buttons, as well as access to their user account and a logout button.

### Individual page views
### Main page:
    As listed above.
### Start looking: 
    Leads on to a filter page where they can apply dietary restrictions (Vegan, Vegetarian, Lactos Free, etc.), and a "Actually start searching" button. From there they flip through recipe images (as well as their name I suppose). When the find a recipe that appeals to them, the user can flip the image card to show a basic description and recipe list. The user can then flip the card back over and keep searching, add the recipe to their shopping list, or add it to their favorite reipes.
### My Favorites: 
    Contains food cards for all the recipes the user has favorited. Cards will behave in the same way as above, allowing users to add to their shopping list or remove the recipe from their favorites.
### Shopping list: 
        Lists the ingredient for all the recipes the user has selected (I should consider whether or not to  combine same ingredients or not) along with a "Done Shopping" button to clear the list.
### Login screen: 
    Bog standard login. Requires user email and password, as well as a registration form.
### User account screen:
     Shows basic user info, as well as allowing them to change their password.

## Your Concerns
    - Beyond the standard "I have no idea what I'm doing, what have I gotten myself into", not much at the moment. I'm sure issues will rear up throughout the process.
