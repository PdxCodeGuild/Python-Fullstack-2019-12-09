print(f'On a pleasant evening in {season}, the breeze was blowing gently. The weather made a {prey} very happy. She flew to a high branch of a tree and sat on it. As the breeze blew, her heart filled with joy and soon she began {activity}. \n \n A hungry hawk was flying past the {location}. He heard the {prey} and looked around. He spotted the {prey}, flew down and caught her in his claws. But the {prey} said, \"What is the use of eating a small {prey} like me? Let me go. A strong and able hunter can surely get a larger prey sometime later.\" \n \n The hawk said, \"Do you think I am a fool? I cannot let go of food when I am hungry. There is no surety that I will get some other prey. Why should I let go of a golden chance now, thinking of what I might get tomorrow?\" \n\n So the intelligent hawk quickly gobbled up the little {prey} and flew away.\n')
