Lab 27: Adventure
Let's build a simple board game that runs on the terminal. We'll represent the board using a list of lists.
We'll use two ints to represent that player's position on the board. Every iteration of the game loop,
the user will be prompted for a command. Start with the code below, and add your own modifications.

Possible modifications:

- use more succinct commands (l/u/d/r for up/down/left/right or n/s/e/w for north/south/east/west)
- add boundaries to the map, when the player attempts to move beyond the boundary, stop them or move them to the other side
- make what's printed on the screen a part of a much larger map (with the player always shown at the center of the screen)
- loading a text file containing the map, or procedurally generate things
- walls / barriers
- use different unicode characters (you can find lists online)
- ascii art
- colorama for custom colors, or curses for even more control of the terminal
- add 'fog of war' - only show the elements of board immediately around the player
(you can then find a torch item, which expands your visibility)
- have enemies move around
- add an inventory system
- add player health, more complex encounters
- add hidden treasure, make the objective to find all the treasure
- add a 'final boss' that you can only face once collecting items
- re-use previous labs (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors)
