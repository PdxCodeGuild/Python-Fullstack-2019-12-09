Lab 11: Guess the Number

Let's play 'Guess the Number'. The computer will guess a random int between 1 and 10. The user will then try to guess the number, and the program will tell them whether they're right or wrong.

Concepts Covered

random.randint
REPL: read-evaluate-print loop
input, print

Version 5 (optional)

Swap the user with the computer: the user will pick a number, and the computer will make random guesses until they get it right.
