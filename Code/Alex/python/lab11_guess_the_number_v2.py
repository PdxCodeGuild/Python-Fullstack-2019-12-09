Lab 11: Guess the Number

Let's play 'Guess the Number'. The computer will guess a random int between 1 and 10. The user will then try to guess the number, and the program will tell them whether they're right or wrong.

Concepts Covered

random.randint
REPL: read-evaluate-print loop
input, print


Version 2

Allow the user to make an unlimited number of guesses using a while True and break. Keep track of how many guesses the user has made, and tell them at the end.
