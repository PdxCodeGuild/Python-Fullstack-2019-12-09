Lab 27: Adventure

Let's build a simple board game that runs on the terminal. We'll represent the board using a list of lists. We'll use two ints to represent that player's position on the board. Every iteration of the game loop, the user will be prompted for a command. Start with the code below, and add your own modifications.

Possible modifications:

use more succinct commands (l/u/d/r for up/down/left/right or n/s/e/w for north/south/east/west)
add boundaries to the map, when the player attempts to move beyond the boundary, stop them or move them to the other side
make what's printed on the screen a part of a much larger map (with the player always shown at the center of the screen)
loading a text file containing the map, or procedurally generate things
walls / barriers
use different unicode characters (you can find lists online)
ascii art
colorama for custom colors, or curses for even more control of the terminal
add 'fog of war' - only show the elements of board immediately around the player (you can then find a torch item, which expands your visibility)
have enemies move around
add an inventory system
add player health, more complex encounters
add hidden treasure, make the objective to find all the treasure
add a 'final boss' that you can only face once collecting items
re-use previous labs (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors)
