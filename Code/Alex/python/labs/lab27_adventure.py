Lab 27: Adventure

Let's build a simple board game that runs on the terminal. We'll represent the board using a list of lists. We'll use two ints to represent that player's position on the board. Every iteration of the game loop, the user will be prompted for a command. Start with the code below, and add your own modifications.

Possible modifications:

*- use more concise commands (l/u/d/r for up/down/left/right or n/s/e/w for north/south/east/west)

*- add boundaries to the map, when the player attempts to move beyond the boundary, stop them or move them to the other side

*- make what's printed on the screen a part of a much larger map (with the player always shown at the center of the screen)

- have enemies move around

- walls / barriers

- add an inventory system

- add hidden treasure, make the objective to find all the treasure

- add player health, more complex encounters

- add a 'final boss' that you can only face once collecting items

- ascii art

- colorama for custom colors, or curses for even more control of the terminal

- loading a text file containing the map, or procedurally generate things

- use different unicode characters (you can find lists online)

- add 'fog of war' - only show the elements of board immediately around the player (you can then find a torch item, which expands your visibility)

- re-use previous labs (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors)
