Lab 26: Any API

Now build an interface around any API of your choosing. You can find a list of free public APIS here. Below are some recommendations.

Look at the documentation, find out the endpoints and general capabilities
Find a url and if possible, enter it into your browser and see if you can get JSON
Look into authentication, might have to register an account to get an API key
Send the request through Python, look at the format of the response
Copy the data into a JSON viewer
Write code to extract the relevant data and display it
OpenWeatherMap - data on weather
Trefle - data on plants
TheCatAPI - data about cats
PokeAPI - data about pokemon
Brickset API - data about legos responds with XML
