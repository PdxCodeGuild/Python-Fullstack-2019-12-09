In the data, rename "measures" to instruments

Implement measures into the program
    - user can choose the amount of measures
    - measures have an algorithm that tells them how to display **figure out how i want them to display**
    - i think there should be a cap of like 12 or 16 measures? maybe more. idk any melodies that are more than that. especially since the idea is to work in chunks


Create the variation generator
    - the user will only be able to generate one instruments variations at a time
    - the generator will take an instrument and displace its beats by one beat, for as many beats that are in the instruments score or collection of measures or measure.


Create the playback line that moves through the measures as the score is played


Create the metronome
    - option for different sound on beat 1
    - check boxes on the toggle switch and the play button on each measure. when checked, it plays
    - it can also play by itself to test tempos but shuts off when toggle switch or play button is activated. unless the check box is checked
