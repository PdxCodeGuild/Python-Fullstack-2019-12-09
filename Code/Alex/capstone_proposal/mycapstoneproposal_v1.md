## Name

**DrumBeat** *(still thinking)*

## Project Overview

### What problem is it attempting to solve?
- Creating, Understanding and hearing variations as a learning platform for drummers to understand patterns and how they work in music and the different possibilities one pattern can have.
- I would like an application that enables drummers to have an interface to notate on. Niched to them specifically.
- Having the ability to take a simple idea on the drums and notate it, give it a name.. and from there, pic a note and click a "all variations" button that takes the note you picked and displaces it in every way it can be displaced within the context

### What are the major features of your web application?
- Drag and drop Drum Notation with sound
- Dynamic Notation by instrument or note
- Mobile friendly
- Computer Generated rhythms based off user created patterns

### What libraries or frameworks will you use?

**VUEJS       DJANGO      HTML5      CSS3** *(possibly: bootstrap, foundation or materialize)*

## Functionality

### Walk through the application from the user's perspective.
- I am a drummer and I am learning how to read music and more importantly understand it and create it myself and HEAR IT before i even have to play it.
- I can create, edit, save and delete a score
- I can favorite scores
- I have a user account

### How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?
- New scores can be saved, edited or deleted

## Data Model

### What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.
**User**
- Email
- Name
- DOB
- Scores

**Score**
- Tempo
- Instruments
- Dynamics
- Notes
- Measures
- text
- Note durations
- play
- stop
- pitch

## Schedule

### Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.

**Week 1**


**Week 2**


**Week 3**


**Stretch**
- Any additional things i didn't achieve in the time span i had
- Deployment
- More tweaking
