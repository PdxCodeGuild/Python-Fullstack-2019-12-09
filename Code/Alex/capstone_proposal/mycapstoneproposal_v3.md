## Functionality

### Walk through the application from the user's perspective.

- This month shows up in your typical calendar format, alright
- I can scroll up and down to different months
- Clicked on a day and I see a list of events for that day and the time frame for each event. The other days are also showing up and I can scroll up and down by day in this nice list format. Then i clicked the "Today" button at the bottom and it scrolled me up today. cool
- Create button at the bottom let me create an event
- I clicked on an event and it gave me more details and the option to not see it next time

### How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

- New events will be saved
- Deleted events will be deleted
- Edited events can be updated

## Data Model
