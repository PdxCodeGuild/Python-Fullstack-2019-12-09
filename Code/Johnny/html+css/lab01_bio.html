      Buyan had signature calling, he wielded an axe, and he was known to decapitate his victims and feeds the remains to his partner, known as Babe the Blue Ox. Now, Babe was overgrown Ox infected with the Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which fueled his carnivorous instinct to crave iron in bloodstream. Paul Bunyan and his Ox would go hunting on the night of the full moon. This lumberjack folklore was passed down between generations and told to misbehaving children as a bedtime story.
