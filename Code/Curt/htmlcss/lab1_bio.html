      <p>Caracalla, also known as Antoninus, was Emperor of the Roman Empire from 211 to 287 CE. He notably issued the Edict of Caracalla, which granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p>He also notably massacred thousands of said citizens for the crime of association with his deceased brother Geta, and is widely considered one of the worst of the Roman emperors.
      <p>His greatest contribution to history, however, was his assassination <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla#Death">by a disaffected soldier while Caracalla was urinating on the side of the road</a>. It is from this murder in the most compromised of situations that we derive the idiom <i>"don't get caught with your pants down"</i> as cautionary advice.</p>
      <p>Upon the death of his brother and co-Emperor Geta, Caracella left Rome, never to return. He spent the entirety of his rule conducting various military campaigns throughout the various provinces of the Roman Empire, which at this time spanned the entirety of Western Europe, the Levant, and Northern Africa. Emperor Pisspants conducted violent campaigns in:</p>
        <li>Raetia (Switzerland/Germany/Austria area)</li>
        <li>Germana Superior (Switzerland/France/Germany area)</li>
        <li>Alexandria</li>
        <li>Armenia</li>
        <li>Parthia (northeastern Iran)</li>
        <li>Edessa (Turkey)</li>
