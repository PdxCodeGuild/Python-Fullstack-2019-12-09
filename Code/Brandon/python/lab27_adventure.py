#Finally the Adventure... Brandon G.

# Possible modifications:
# 
#    ** use more succinct commands (l/u/d/r for up/down/left/right or n/s/e/w for north/south/east/west)
#     add boundaries to the map, when the player attempts to move beyond the boundary, stop them or move them to the other side
#     make what's printed on the screen a part of a much larger map (with the player always shown at the center of the screen)
#     loading a text file containing the map, or procedurally generate things
#     walls / barriers
#     use different unicode characters (you can find lists online)
#     ascii art
#     colorama for custom colors, or curses for even more control of the terminal
#     add 'fog of war' - only show the elements of board immediately around the player (you can then find a torch item, which expands your visibility)
#     have enemies move around
#     add an inventory system
#     add player health, more complex encounters
#     add hidden treasure, make the objective to find all the treasure
#     add a 'final boss' that you can only face once collecting items
#     re-use previous labs (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors)
