## Domain Names

Most hosting services will give your website a default domain name, but if you want something custom, you'll have to rent it from a domain registrar. You can then add a DNS record to associate it with your server's IP address. You can read more about domains on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name).


## HTTPS

To allow your site to use HTTP, you must install an SSL Certificate on your server. SSL certificates can be purchased from a Commercial Certificate Authority, created with Let's Encrypt, or self-signed.
