Now build an interface around any API of your choosing. You can find a list of free public APIS [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Below are some recommendations.

1. Look at the documentation, find out the endpoints and general capabilities
2. Find a url and if possible, enter it into your browser and see if you can get JSON
3. Look into authentication, might have to register an account to get an API key
4. Send the request through Python, look at the format of the response
5. Copy the data into a JSON viewer
6. Write code to extract the relevant data and display it

- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) - data on weather
- [Trefle](https://trefle.io/) - data on plants
- [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) - data about cats
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) - data about pokemon
- [Brickset API](https://brickset.com/tools/webservices/v2) - data about legos **responds with [XML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1912434/how-do-i-parse-xml-in-python)**
