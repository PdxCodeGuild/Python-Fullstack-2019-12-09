[link](../docs/01%20Flask.md#16-apis)

- Use the [FavQs API](https://favqs.com/api) to get a random quote and display it, then allow the user to search for quotes and see a list of results, then maybe allow them to save their favorites to a database.

- Use the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API to show the current weather and a forecast for the week. You can use the [built-in icons](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions#Icon-list) or these [more minimal ones](https://websygen.github.io/owfont/).
